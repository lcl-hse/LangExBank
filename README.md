##  Installation
Learner Corpora Laboratory uses Docker to deploy LangExBank.

Copy <i>docker-compose.yml</i> file from the root of this respository to your machine

Then, open your favourite text editor and create a file in the LangExBank folder called <i>env.prod</i>. This file will contain environment variables needed for LangExBank to run in a Docker environment. Fill the file with the following contents (Meaning of every variable will be explained later):
```

Change variables in LangExBank/env.prod to appropriate values. 

Open <i>docker-compose.yml</i> file in your text editor.

Change in
```
ports:
  - 12345:80
depends_on:
  - web
```

"12345" to the port you want to run LangExBank on.

Run the following commands in your terminal emulator:

```bash
cd LangExBank
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --no-input --clear
```

Then navigate to your domain or IP address in your web browser.

## Creating users
LangExBank support three type of users: Admin, Teacher and Student. To start using LangExBank after deploy you will need to create at least 1 admin user.

You can create new users with three different approaches:

### Creating users with django-admin
To add, edit and delete users with Django-Admin web application you need to create a superuser first:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Enter new superuser data according to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/#creating-an-admin-user">Django documentation</a>. Then navigate to <i>yoursite.example.com/admin</i> in your web browser and enter your superuser name and password to access database editing. Then in section <b>MAIN_APP</b> section select <i>Users</i> option (please do not confuse it with <i>Users</i> in <b>AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION</b> section.  Then click on <b>ADD USER</b> button and input user data, including username, full name, password and rights (Student, Teacher or Admin) and password(<i>Enc passsword</i> field).

### Creating users in IPython terminal
You can create, delete and edit users in Django IPython console. To do this type in your terminal emulator:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py shell
```

Your terminal will change to IPython console. Then type the following to import LangExBank object-relational database mappings:
```python
from main_app.models import *
```

Now you will be able to create new users like this (<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/#playing-with-the-api">Django docs</a>):
```python
u = User(login='admin', enc_password='please-change-me', rights='A', full_name='The Admin Admin'
u.save()
```
where 'A' represents Admin rights, 'S' - Student rights and 'T' - Teacher rights.

To exit IPython session type the following in your terminal:
```python
exit()
```

### Creating random users
You can create random users with LangExBank management command random_users. Type the following in your terminal:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py random_users -n 100 -r S -s -fn Users.csv
```

The provided arguments to <i>random_users</i> command are explained below:
<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <code>-n --number</code>
  </td>
  <td>
   Integer. How many users to create e.g. 100
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <code>-r --rights</code>
  </td>
  <td>
   What type of rights to give to the newly created users. Possible options: 'A' (Admin), 'S' (Student) or 'T' (Teacher)
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <code>-s --save</code>
  </td>
  <td>
   Whether to save newly generated users to CSV file.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <code>-fn --filename</code>
  </td>
  <td>
   Name of the CSV file where new user logins and passwords will be saved.
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

CSV file with user data will be save in your Docker container. To transfer it to your host machine type the following in your terminal emulator:
```bash
docker cp testingplatform_web_1:/home/app_web/LangExBank/Users.csv .
```

If the command results with an error replace <i>testingplatform_web_1</i> with your container name. If you want to specify exact location where you want to place Users csv replace the dot with the folder path.

## New users registration
You can allow new students to register on your LangExBank instance using embedded registration view. To enable this set <code>LANGEXBANK_OPEN_SIGNUP</code> to 1 in <i>LangExBank/env.prod</i> file. Then send <i>yoursite.example.com/easy_register</i> to your students. In order to register the students will be asked to type Full Name, Group id, username and password. In current version of LangExBank no e-mail confirmation is required to register.

## Corpus-based quizzes
You can create quizzes from questions imported from REALEC.

### Filling exercise bank
On the LangExBank main page navigate to the <b>Questions</b> panel to access question bank. Click on <b>Add questions from REALEC</b> button at the bottom to navigate to the question import page. At the question import page fill the following fields:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Enter path to REALEC folder</td>
  <td>Path to folder in <a href="http://realec.org">REALEC</a> corpus in POSIX format (e.g. <i>/exam/exam2018/</i>)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Select error tag from REALEC (selector)</td>
  <td>1 or more error tags from REALEC annotation scheme. By default errors with all tags will be included</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Make questions multiple choice (checkbox)</td>
  <td>Whether to generate multiple-choice questions. Currently multiple choice option generation models support only the following types of errors:
<ul>
 <li>Choice of tense</li>
 <li>Prepositions</li>
 <li>Choice of a lexical item</li>
</ul>
</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Create new folder with name (checkbox)</td>
  <td>Whether to create a new folder in LangExBank with recently generated questions.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Create new folder with name (text field)</td>
  <td>Name for the new folder (if the option <i>Create new folder with name</i> is selected)</td>
 </tr>
</table>

After filling the form click on the <b>Generate questions</b> button. Generating questions may take several minutes especially in the case of multiple choice questions. Then you will be redirected to the <b>Questions</b> panel.

### Listening
To create an exercise of type Listening select <b>Listening</b> option in <b>Section type</b> field

## Reviewing results
The processs of reviewing results is practicully the same for both corpus-based quizzes and IELTS-like tests.

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Student</td>
  <td>Group</td>
  <td>Mark</td>
  <td></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Student John Johnson</td>
  <td>Group 1</td>
  <td>0.9</td>
  <td>Details</td>
 </tr>
</table>

To review results of a particular student click <b>Details</b> right to the row with his name. Now you will be able to see answers submitted by the student as well as right answers to quiz questions. To edit mark for each question navigate your cursor to mark column and enter new mark in floating point number format (e.g. <i>0.9</i> or <i>2.0</i>. If you think that the answer submotted by a student was correct click <b>Mark as new correct</b> below answer. (Warning: the answer will be counted as correct only for new test takers). Adding new correct answer is not supported for multiple choice questions. When you are done reviewing student results click <b>Save changes</b> at the bottom of the page to apply your changes.
